        "WoM_DS_NotFinishedTutorial1": "Don't get ahead of yourself young whippersnapper, go finish up what the others are asking you to do. Come see me after all that.",
        "WoM_DS_Intro1": "Good, you've got the basics under your belt, but now the guide ropes are off. Taking down a dragon won't be easy, but you've got the skills you need to do it. Well... almost.",
        "WoM_DS_Intro2": "We need to start thinking long term. Bramblemead village is an excellent place for an outpost, even if it's a little overrun with goblins right now. ",
        "WoM_DS_Intro3": "We should build our new base of operations here. By we, I mean you -- bad back.  ",
        "WoM_DS_Intro4": "Doesn't need to be fancy -- though style is always worth pursuing -- but it needs to be functional. Make a shelter, some foundations, walls, and a roof, and then build and claim a bed in it.",
        "WoM_DS_Intro5": "You can go bigger, of course, let your inner architect run wild, but the bed's the bare minimum we need to get started. Go on, hop to it. Get!",
        "WoM_DS_NotClaimedABed1": "Not finished yet? The longer you leave things, the more likely you are to become a dragon's dinner.",
        "WoM_DS_MadeBed1": "Good, you've built a shelter. I mean... it could do with some work, we're gonna be here a while. Have you considered the decor at all?",
        "WoM_DS_MadeBed2": "Maybe some better lighting? Curtains? A single potted plant? *Sigh* no, no, you're right. It's not important. Why live it up when there's so much squalor to enjoy?",
        "WoM_DS_MadeBed3": "Anyway, look, we're set up here, but there's one of our number missing. Young Cathan, an adventurer in training that came along with us.",
        "WoM_DS_MadeBed4": "He disappeared after we got the lodestone working, vanished before you arrived. I'd like to track him down. To do that I need to cast a locator spell.",
        "WoM_DS_MadeBed5": "I'm just missing one ingredient, which I'll need from you. Antlers. You can get them from deer, hunt one and bring me the antlers. Then we'll get started. But first, here, take this. ",
        "WoM_DS_NotFoundCathanJournal_Castle": "Not found young Cathan yet? Last we heard he'd been captured by the goblins up at the Brynmoor Castle. I'll need you to storm in there and rescue him.",
        "WoM_DS_FoundCathanJournal1": "Any sign of young Cathan? What -- he escaped, even managed to turn a few goblins to his cause? Interesting lad that, going to go places.",
        "WoM_DS_FoundCathanJournal2": "Speaking of going places, you mention he's exploring a dragonkin vault in the swamps? I think you probably want to go and take a look. No?",
        "Goblin_DS_VaultConvo1": "Oh no, not another human. You gonna just leave me to die too? Like the last one did?",
        "Goblin_DS_VaultConvo2": "Got us all riled up. Promised us power and glory. Said he knews how to get rid of the big scaly war king.",
        "Goblin_DS_VaultConvo3": "Well he got what he wanted, some weird dragonkin stuff, then he said he were heading into Ghornfell and that I'd just slow us down. The others agreed, gits.",
        "Goblin_DS_VaultConvo4": "So I bet you're just like him, so I aint gonna talk to yous no more. Yeah, that'll teach yas!",
        "WoM_DS_SpokenToGoblin1": "So, young Cathan's pushing his way into Ghornfell, eh? Reckless, as always, that boy's gonna get himself killed.",
        "WoM_DS_SpokenToGoblin2": "But, if he's braving the garou, he must know a way of dealing with Velgar. There's no other reason he'd do something quite so stupid.",
        "WoM_DS_SpokenToGoblin3": "Look, I hate to ask this, but I need you to go after him. You need to fight your way into Ghornfell and pick up his trail.",
        "WoM_DS_SpokenToGoblin4": "Ghornfell's no joke though, that's where the garou live and if you thought goblins were trouble you're in for a shock.",
        "WoM_DS_SpokenToGoblin5": "Horrible creatures, the garou. Deadly beastmen with no concept of mercy. You'll need to make sure you're as prepared as you can be, before you risk facing them in battle.",
        "Cathan_DS_NotGotAmulet1": "OoooOOOOooOOOOoooOOoooOOOooo!",
        "Cathan_DS_NotGotAmulet2": "The spirit gestures emphatically at the backpack on the floor.",
        "Cathan_DS_DoesNotHaveHorn1": "So, first off, death sucks. Let's just get that out of the way. I figured I might at least stand a chance against Velgar, I had all the plans, and I am sure I could have beaten him.",
        "Cathan_DS_DoesNotHaveHorn2": "But then his garou minions mobbed me and dragged me here. They held me down as Velgar watched, laughing as they sacrificed me!",
        "Cathan_DS_DoesNotHaveHorn3": "As death's go it could have been more heroic. Not exactly what I wanted on my epitaph. But, hey, silver cloud, you can avenge me now!",
        "Cathan_DS_DoesNotHaveHorn4": "Here, let me teach you a recipe. It's a dragonkin horn that will force Velgar to battle. It's got to be used here, in an altar on the tower, but Velgar can't refuse it.",
        "Cathan_DS_DoesNotHaveHorn5": "Make the horn, summon the dragon and then kick his ass for me. I'm counting on you, hero, we all are.",
        "Cathan_DS_HasHorn1": "You've made the horn! Now you can finally avenge me. Use it on the altar in the tower over there.",
        "Cathan_DS_HasHorn2": "But be ready, once you summon Velgar, he'll not give you a chance to change your mind.",
        "WoM_DS_SpokenToCathan_NotKilledVelgar1": "Cathan's dead? To shreds you say? Poor lad, not the end he deserved. But Velgar's made a mistake here, he's made this personal.",
        "WoM_DS_SpokenToCathan_NotKilledVelgar2": "I generally discourage violence, but this time I think you need to gather as much of it as possible and serve up a dragon sized portion.",
        "WoM_DS_SpokenToCathan_NotKilledVelgar3": "Build the horn. Summon Velgar. Avenge Cathan, save us all. Punch a dragon in the face!",
        "Cathan_DS_KilledVelgar1": "You did it! Velgar got what he deserved. Thank you, hero, now I can rest in peace.",
        "WoM_DS_HasVelgarHead1": "The dragon's dead, that's quite the victory. No, really, you should be proud of yourself!",
        "WoM_DS_HasVelgarHead2": "It's not every day you take out a draconic general infused with the elemental power of the earth. But you managed it, well done!",
        "WoM_DS_HasVelgarHead3": "Here, I'll take that rapidly decomposing head off you and give you something much better in return.",
        "WoM_DS_HasVelgarHead4": "We can relax for a little while, but not forever. Velgar was one tough cookie, but he's just the foot soldier. Queen Kuldra is out there somewhere and she won't sit quietly for long.",
        "WoM_DS_NoSpaceInInventory": "I've got something to give you, but you've got your hands full. Go clear some space and then come back to me. ",
        "PlayerChoice_AboutDragons": "Tell me more about these dragons.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutDragons1": "When my comrades and I set foot on Ashenfall, we thought it would be paradise. Lush green fields, tall and resilient trees – a world unsullied.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutDragons2": "But then dragons happened.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutDragons3": "They swooped down from the skies and decimated the landing party. Whole teams of people, gone, just like that.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutDragons4": "\"Queen Kuldra bids you welcome,\" they laughed, as our comrades drew their final breaths.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutDragons5": "So here's the deal: I need you to kill them all. Show these dragons and their Queen, that we're not just going to roll over and die.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutDragons6": "We fight back, and we fight back hard.",
        "PlayerChoice_AboutVelgar": "Can you tell me about Velgar?",
        "WoM_DS_AboutVelgar1": "General Velgar, let that sink in. A title, on a dragon, not a good sign.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutVelgar2": "We don't know much at the moment, since everyone who's seen him is dead.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutVelgar3": "But he's big, scary and he wants to make all of us wyrm food. So, diplomacy's out.",
        "PlayerChoice_AboutKuldra": "Can you tell me about Queen Kuldra?",
        "WoM_DS_AboutKuldra1": "I know very little about this Kuldra character, except that Velgar pledged his loyalty to her.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutKuldra2": "From what I can gather, she's something like royalty to the dragons here; never a good sign.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutKuldra3": "She's spoken of not with the reverence due a monarch, but with the devotion due a deity.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutKuldra4": "I don't like that. Not one itty little bit.",
        "PlayerChoice_AboutCathan": "Can you tell me about the previous adventurer?",
        "WoM_DS_AboutCathan1": "Cathan, now there was a pain in the neck.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutCathan2": "Young noble sprog, low down the pecking order. Fifth son, I think. Wanted to be a hero, you know how it goes.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutCathan3": "Got into scraps as a boy. Lost his leg to a wolf. Say what you want, he had guts that kid.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutCathan4": "The \"legendary\" swordsman Vannaka taught him the art of swordplay, while I instructed him in the arcane.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutCathan5": "He was a constant annoyance—loud, irritating, overflowing with relentless optimism. You know the type. Even so, his absence leaves a void.",
        "PlayerChoice_AboutDragonkin": "Can you tell me about the Dragonkin?",
        "WoM_DS_AboutDragonkin1": "Relatively little is known about the Dragonkin, less still the ones who set up shop here.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutDragonkin2": "We know that they're ancient, dangerous and constantly angry. They were cursed by the elder gods a long, long, long time ago.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutDragonkin3": "They have a penchant for two things that interest us. First, they make dragons, which is the problem we're facing right now.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutDragonkin4": "Secondly, they hoard secrets like they're more valuable than gold... or party hats.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutDragonkin5": "Their vaults will be guarded, but well worth exploring. You never know what you might find in there.",
        "PlayerChoice_AboutGarou": "Can you tell me about the Garou?",
        "WoM_DS_AboutGarou1": "I don't have much for you there, Vannaka's the one investigating them. He's pushing his way into Ghornfell, you should look for him there.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutGarou2": "What I know is that the garou are merciless. They'll cut you down without a chance to speak.",
        "WoM_DS_AboutGarou3": "Beastmen from another world, living only for the hunt. Best avoided if you can, but be prepared for a tough fight where you can't.",
        "CathanJournal_Castle_title": "Cathan's Journal [Castle]",
        "CathanJournal_Castle_Content": "Just waiting for Spitfoot to bring me the keys, then next stop is the blue-flamed door in the swamps. It holds the secret to Velgar’s destruction, I just know it. For now I’ll bide my time, enjoying the spectacle of goblin hospitality. \r\n\r\nI enjoy being a goblin’s prisoner, there’s a kind of dance to the whole thing. They threaten, they shout, they exclaim all the horrible things they intend to do to you, and then they never go through with it. \r\n\r\nGoblin culture is like that. The strong hold power, but it’s mostly performative -- because if you make yourself too much of a threat, someone’s gonna challenge you to make you prove you deserve it. \r\n\r\nThe dragon hasn’t learned that lesson about goblin faith. \r\n\r\nBandos was a nutjob, Zanik will tell you, but he got his people to behave exactly how he wanted. Conflict for conflict’s sake, everyone just itching to beat up their boss. Which is how I’ve got a few of them wrapped round my finger – because I’ve let it slip that I’m gunning for their god. \r\n\r\nVelgar isn’t a god, he’s just a dragon, but he’s the toughest guy around and so they treat him as such. But I’ve worked out that path to taking him down and enough of these guys are thinking that I can do what I say. So they’re coming with me, we’re making a coup, and big old green-and-scaley’s getting an axe to the face. \r\n\r\nJust as soon as Spitfoot gets here, we’ll make for that blue-flamed swamp door, where there’s a piece of the puzzle that’ll set my plan in motion. \r\n",

        "CathanJournal_Ghornfell_Content": "The goblins warn me about Ghornfell and the creatures within it. They call them the garou, and they shiver when they say it. I’ve heard them mention them before, in the stories, myths and legends of this place – beastial warriors, that Bandos came here to destroy. He failed. \r\n\r\nThe god of war, failed to destroy the Garou and their goddess. That should tell you something. \r\n\r\nI’ll be careful. I’ll sneak past their fortifications, I need to get through to the tower that rises in the heard of these Fractured Plains. That’s where Velgar rests. \r\n\r\nThat’s where I’ll destroy him. \r\n",

        "WoM_DS_NotFoundCathanGhost1": "You've made it into Ghornfel, I'm impressed. No, honestly, I expected you to drown in the swamp or something. ",
        "WoM_DS_NotFoundCathanGhost2": "But if the entrance to Ghornfel is what you say, it sounds like Cathan has been captured...again... so I need you to go and rescue him. ",
        "WoM_DS_NotFoundCathanGhost3": "I imagine the garou will be taking him to Velgar. Make your way to the tower, and pray you're not too late. ",
        "Cathan_DS_TooEarly": "Oh dear... I'm dead...",
        "WoM_DS_NeedVelgarHead1": "What's that? Velgar's dead? Are you sure? I'll need to see his head, dragons can be tricky like that. ",
        "WoM_DS_NeedVelgarHead2": "Bring me his head and I'll make sure you're rewarded. ",
        "WoM_DS_RefuseToHandOverHead": "OK... not sure why you want to keep a decomposing dragon's head around, but you do you I guess. ",
        "WoM_DS_HasManyHeads1": "But, we'll worry about that later. Here, let me take that slimey, smelly dragon he... why do you have so many of them?",
        "WoM_DS_HasManyHeads2": "Do you just carry multiple heads around with you? Is that normal to you?",
        "WoM_DS_HasManyHeads3": "Eh, whatever, I've seen weirder. Hand them over, I'll turn them into something more useful.",
        "Altar_DS_HasRecipe": "There is an indention in the altar where something would be placed. It looks like it would fit the shape of Cathan's summoning horn design. ",

        "WoM_DS_NotGotDeerHorn2": "You'll find it easier to hunt one if you craft yourself a bow of some kind. The deer themselves are all over Bramblemead, finding them shouldn't be a problem.",
        "WoM_DS_NotGotDeerHorn3": "Just hunt one down, and bring me the antlers. You can keep all the other useful materials, maybe use them to craft better gear? You're looking a bit shabby.",
        "WoM_DS_NotGotDeerHorn_Struggling1": "You're really struggling with this, aren't you? I'll walk you through exactly what to do, but I can't be holding your hand all the time.",
        "WoM_DS_NotGotDeerHorn_Struggling2": "Discover, learn and improve. That's going to need to be your mantra on Ashenfall if you're going to survive. So find new materials, discover new recipes and then make them.",
        "WoM_DS_NotGotDeerHorn_Struggling3": "To hunt deer you'll want a bow. Find some flax and some wood, this should be enough to help you build a spinning wheel. There you'll make thread and with that you can craft a bow.",
        "WoM_DS_NotGotDeerHorn_Struggling4": "Find feathers to make arrows, and then you're good to go. While you're at it, look for recipes that will let you make stronger gear. You're going to need it.",
        "WoM_DS_GotHorn1": "Ah excellent, you've got one, we can begin. This ritual is a bit old school, proper druidic guff, but it's handy in a pinch.",
        "WoM_DS_GotHorn2": "It homes in on the spiritual residue of our subject, in this case young Cathan, using this old shoe of his as a spiritual connection. Vile, but useful. Just don't sniff it.",
        "WoM_DS_GotHorn3": "We'll then just point the antler at the map, and it'll point straight to where we'll find him... or at least where he's been most the last couple of days.",
        "WoM_DS_GotHorn4": "Now then, we just need to spread the rune essence like so. Add a dash of this weird unguent stuff Zanik made from snails, and then...",
        "WoM_DS_GotHorn5": "Ah... the castle, not ideal. That place is a veritable goblin stronghold. Go see if you can find him, but make sure you're geared up for a fight.",

I still remember how he trained me, instilling me with a hatred for him that pushed me right past the pain. He was merciless, he was relentless, his training made me ache every day. So I took months of resentment and I balled them into a fist and with all of my loathing rammed it right into his face.  \r\n\r\nHe was so proud. So proud that I punched him. So pleased with me for bruising his jaw. Because that was the first time I had walked on my new leg, without having to think through every painful motion.\r\n\r\nHe had given me something else to turn my loathing on, that wasn’t myself.\r\n\r\nThat lummox took a broken kid, ready to give up on the world, and turned him into a warrior.\r\n\r\nHe’s a good man, Vannaka, even if he won’t always admit it. So of course, I said I’d join him on this new adventure.\r\n\r\nI feel like there’s more than just a curiosity here for him. Something deeper. Something hidden. A pain behind the eyes.
