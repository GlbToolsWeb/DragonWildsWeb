        "WoM_FS_Intro1": "Welcome to Ashenfall, sorry about the mess. Had a bit of a dragon problem, that's why we've called for you.",
        "WoM_FS_Intro2": "You've come at a great time. Heroic opportunities await. This long-forgotten place is just screaming to be explored.",
        "WoM_FS_Intro3": "But before all that, how about we take you through some survival basics?",
        "Player_Choice_FS_AcceptTutorial": "Yes please [Begin Tutorial]",
        "Player_Choice_FS_SkipTutorial": "I can work it out [Skip Tutorial]",
        "WoM_FS_AcceptedTutorial1": "You'll want to get to grips with gathering and crafting first, Doric can help you with that.",
        "WoM_FS_AcceptedTutorial2": "You'll find him outside the temple. Check your map if you get lost, but he should be easy to spot.",
        "WoM_FS_AcceptedTutorial3": "He's the only dwarf on the continent, that we know of anyway, can't miss him.",
        "WoM_FS_SkippedTutorial1": "Fair enough, I do like someone that can show initiative.",
        "WoM_FS_SkippedTutorial2": "But not here. Come find me in Bramblemead Village, and we'll get you started.",
        "WoM_Generic": "Aren't you helping the others out? What are you talking to me for? Check your map if you're not sure what you're meant to be doing.",
        "WoM_FS_DragonSlayer_Started": "Oh, don't mind me here. I'm just enjoying the architecture. I'll meet you at Bramblemead Village if you want to chat. ",
        "Doric_RTftJ_Intro1": "By Saradomin's big bushy beard! Just our luck, a great ruddy dragon. Think it were him that got the others - may they rest in peace.",
        "Doric_RTftJ_Intro2": "And look at ya! Not a knife to yer name, no, no, we can't be doing with that. Come on, let's get you prepared. You need to go and craft a stone club.",
        "Doric_RTftJ_Intro3": "It won't kill a dragon, but it's better than nothing and it'll help you live a bit longer, giving you time to make something better.",
        "Doric_RTftJ_Intro4": "You'll need to gather stone and ash logs, which you can find laying around, then you'll want to build a crafting table to craft the club.",
        "Doric_RTftJ_Intro5": "Oh, I'm Doric by the way. Resident blacksmith and craftsperson on this expedition. Nice to meet you. Now, stop standing around and go make that club!",
        "Doric_RTftJ_NotMadeClub1": "You'll want to build yourself a crafting table. Then once you've done that craft yourself a stone club.",
        "Doric_RTftJ_NotMadeClub2": "Both require stone and ash logs, which you'll find scattered all over the ground around here.",
        "Doric_RTftJ_MadeClub1": "Aye, that's a fine club you got there, but even the best weapons break over time. When that happens use a crafting bench to repair your gear.",
        "Doric_RTftJ_MadeClub2": "Before you go, here, something to help you on your way.",
        "Vannaka_RC_Intro1": "Well met, young pup. Looking to get yourself ready to face off against a dragon? You'll need more than that potato masher to kill one, but you've got to start somewhere.",
        "Vannaka_RC_Intro2": "Look, you may have a weapon, but every great warrior knows wars are won by the stomach, not the blade.",
        "Vannaka_RC_Intro3": "Behind me, up that little hill, is a windmill infested with rats. I want you to kill some of them and cook their meat.",
        "Vannaka_RC_Intro4": "Don't pull that face, you can't be a picky eater in a place like this. Food will make you healthier and heartier, and much more likely to survive.",
        "Vannaka_RC_Intro5": "Properly cook a rat roast and bring them back to me. You'll probably burn a few along the way, don't let that disuade you. No one said survival would be pretty.",
        "Vannaka_RC_NoProgress1": "Well met, young pup. Seems like you haven't managed to cook that rat roast for me yet. You can get them by killing giant rats and cooking their meat. You can find some up by the windmill. ",
        "Vannaka_RC_HasKebabs1": "Well met, young pup. Seems your hunt was successful, I see you've gathered the food I asked for.",
        "Vannaka_RC_HasKebabs2": "It may not exactly be gourmet cooking, but a meal like this could make the difference between life and death. You'll not be taking on any dragons if you're starving to death. ",
        "Vannaka_RC_HasKebabs3": "You will find rats are annoyingly resilient to clubs. Some enemies can resist certain damage types and be vulnerable to others.",
        "Vannaka_RC_HasKebabs4": "Rats, for example, don't take kindly to getting stabbed. Here, take this little butterknife to make it easier to fight them in future. You can have this as well, it'll help you with what's next.",
        "Vannaka_RC_HasKebabs5": "Right, let's teach you a bit about magic. Zanik's the one to talk to for that, you can find her down the road just before the river.",
        "Zanik_RM_LinkToWoM2": "Better not keep him waiting too long, he gets real cranky. ",
        "Zanik_RM_LinkToWoM1": "Right, now that you've learned the basics, it's time to get started. The Wise Old Man is waiting for you just outside Bramblemead Village. Follow your compass to find him.",
        "Zanik_RM_HasRunes2": "You'll unlock new spells as you improve your skills. Here, this book should help you toward that. Have a play around with them, you'll find they can be incredibly useful.",
        "Zanik_RM_HasRunes1": "Great work! Runes are the lifeblood of magic, you'll need them to cast spells and use magic staves. A well placed spell can make all the difference.",
        "Zanik_RM_HasLogs_NoRunes": "Not made the runes yet? You'll need to mine essence from the floating geysers and then craft air and astral runes on a rune altar.",
        "Zanik_RM_HasLogs5": "See those geysers around, with the floating rocks? Take this pickaxe and mine some essence from them, build a rune altar and then craft the runes from rune essence.",
        "Zanik_RM_HasLogs4": "But, magic comes at a cost -- runes. You'll need both air and astral runes to cast Axtral projection, so here's how to get them.",
        "Zanik_RM_HasLogs3": "Axtral projection will let you slice down trees with a wave of your fingers. Much less time consuming than the lumberjack gig.",
        "Zanik_RM_HasLogs2": "Fortunately, we've got magic! As you improve in a skill you'll discover spells that you can use, such as my favourite - Axtral Projection.",
        "Zanik_RM_HasLogs1": "Great, you've got them. Now, between you and me, that was a bit repetitive right? I'd be exhausted having to do that all the time.",
        "Zanik_RM_Intro1": "Dragons, it had to be dragons. Oh, hi, sorry, nice to meet you, I'm Zanik. I'm the local survival and goblin expert around here.",
        "Zanik_RM_SpokenTo_NoLogs": "Cut down trees and gather 50 ash logs, then bring them to me.",
        "Zanik_RM_Intro4": "About fifty ash logs should do it, so make sure you've got a well maintained axe. Shouldn't take too long, come back to me when you have them.",
        "Zanik_RM_Intro3": "Here, I'll show you. First, let's look at things without magic to help you. I need you to cut down a couple of trees and bring me some ash logs. Simple, right?",
        "Zanik_RM_Intro2": "The interesting thing about Ashenfall is that it's laced with magic. Anima everywhere, pouring out of the ground. Which we can use to our advantage.",
        "Doric_NoRoomInInventory": "Oh dear, you seem a little overburdened at the moment. Come and see me when you've got some space free in your backpack. ",
        "Vannaka_NoRoomInInventory": "Hrmm, seems you're carrying the weight of the world right now. Come see me again when you've got some space free in your backpack. ",
        "Zanik_NoRoomInInventory": "Oh wow, bit of a packrat are we? You're carrying too much right now, come back and chat with me when you've cleared some space from your backpack. ",
        "Doric_Generic": "Gathering resources and crafting items, that's the basics of survival in this place. Seek out new resources to discover new recipes.",
        "Vannaka_Generic": "Life on Ashenfall is rarely peaceful. Make sure you're well fed and always have a weapon to hand. Keep an eye on enemy weaknesses to dispatch them quickly. ",
        "Doric_SkippedWom": "Oh dear, you just walked right past the Wise Old Man. He won't like that. Best go back and say hi, eh?",
        "Doric_RTftJ_NextStep": "Now you've got something to fight with, go chat to Vannaka over to the north east, he can teach you how to keep fighting fit.",
        "Doric_RTftJ_MadeDagger1": "Oh, you made a dagger, not a club? Aye, it's a nice piece of work, not what I asked for, but that's fine.",
        "Doric_RTftJ_MadeDagger2": "Now, even the best weapons break over time. When that happens use a crafting bench to repair your gear.",
        "Vannaka_RC_NotDoneRTftJ": "Getting ahead of yourself, aren't we, young pup? Check your map to see where you're meant to be headed. ",
        "Zanik_Generic": "There are secrets hidden all over Ashenfall, I'm sure of it. Look around, explore, and see what you can find. ",
        "Zanik_NotDoneRTftJ": "I think someone is looking for you. Mentioned a task they needed you to complete. Check your map for where to find them. ",
        "Zanik_NotDoneRC": "Vannaka was looking for you, mentioned something about fine dining?",
        "LO_Title": "Log On",
        "LO_Description": "Zanik wants to teach you the basics of woodcutting.",
        "FS_Title": "First Steps",
        "FS_Description": "Begin your adventure.",
        "RTftJ_Title": "Getting Started",
        "RTftJ_Description": "Doric wants to teach you some survival basics. ",
        "RC_Title": "Ratcatcher",
        "RC_Description": "Vannaka wants to teach you the basics of hunting, fighting and cooking. ",
        "RM_Title": "Rune Mysteries",
        "RM_Description": "Zanik wants you to learn the basics of crafting runes.",
        "Vannaka_RC_Intro_Dagger": "Well met, young pup. Looking to get yourself ready to face off against a dragon? You'll need more than that butter knife to kill one, but you've got to start somewhere.",
        "Doric_RTftJ_Intro_WaterNeeded1": "But look at you, all skin and bones. Must be proper parched after a journey like that.",
        "Doric_RTftJ_Intro_WaterNeeded2": "Dehydration and starvation are deadlier than dragons, so you're going to need keep an eye on your basic needs, like hunger and thirst.",
        "Doric_RTftJ_Intro_WaterNeeded3": "I've marked two ponds on your map, to the northwest and south of us. Grab some water from there and bring it back here. Then I'll teach you what you'll need to survive.",
        "Doric_RTftJ_Intro_WaterNeeded4": "If you see a redberry bush along the way, grab yourself a handful. Not much of a meal, but a little food is better than no food at all.",
        "Doric_RTftJ_GotWater1": "Ah good, you've got some water. Bit dirty, I know, but better than nothing. Be careful though, the water's tainted and it'll make life difficult if you drink too much.",
        "Doric_RTftJ_GotWater2": "Zanik says boiling it sorts it all out. So might want to give that a look later, when you've got a chance. Anyway, time we got you all set up to survive this harsh land.",
        "Doric_RTftJ_Intro_AlreadyGotWater1": "Ah, but you've got a good head on yer shoulders. I see you've already got some water, so you won't die of thirst. ",
        "Doric_RTftJ_Intro_AlreadyGotWater2": "Still, it's going to be tough surviving this place with a dragon about. ",
        "WS_WiseOldMan_Objective1": "Speak to the Wise Old Man to learn about Lifewards.",
        "WS_WiseOldMan_Objective2": "Craft a Small Wardstone at a Rune Altar and bring it to the Wise Old Man.",
        "WS_WiseOldMan_Objective3": "Bring your Small Wardstone to the Wise Old Man.",
        "WS_WiseOldMan_Intro1": "Ah, I see you've discovered Ashenfall's little \"blacksmith benefit\", as I like to call it. Lifeward!",
        "WS_WiseOldMan_Intro2": "Crafting certain equipment intrinsically involves the weaving of small threads of enchantment, granting you greater protection.",
        "WS_WiseOldMan_Intro3": "Handy stuff, especially with dragons about. Now, you'll find that your Lifewards can get depleted by the brutality of the other creatures on Ashenfall.",
        "WS_WiseOldMan_Intro4": "To recharge them, you'll need to craft yourself wardstones. These impressive little doohickies will recharge the Lifeward enchantments on your armour... at a small cost.",
        "WS_WiseOldMan_Intro5": "A bit of damage to your soul. Don't worry, it's not permanent, but perhaps avoid overindulging in Wardstones, eh?",
        "WS_WiseOldMan_Intro6": "Go and craft me one small wardstone and bring it here so I can check your working. You just need to gather some rune essence and stone, and craft it at a rune altar. Nice and simple. One small wardstone will do.",
        "WS_WiseOldMan_NotMadeStone": "Go and craft a wardstone and bring it here so I can check your working. You just need to gather some rune essence and stone, and craft them at a rune altar. Nice and simple. One wardstone will do.",
        "WS_WiseOldMan_MadeStone1": "Ah, you've made one. Lovely. See, that barely hurt at all. Just a little drop of blood, nothing to cry about. But now, when your lifeward is damaged, you can repair it.",
        "WS_WiseOldMan_MadeStone2": "Just use a wardstone and BAM! Instant Lifeward recharge. Sure, it'll tear a bit out of your soul, but so will listening to Doric talk about hammers for three hours.",
        "WS_WiseOldMan_MadeStone3": "Just don't use too many at once, and you'll be fine. Right, go on, get out there and slay that dragon!",
        "WS_QuestName": "Warding Off Danger",
        "WS_QuestDesc": "The Wise Old Man wants to teach you about Lifewards and how to recharge them.",
        "WS_WiseOldMan_NoInventorySpace": "Hrmm, I have something for you, but it appears you've overloaded yourself like a magpie gone mad. Clear some space, then come and see me.",
        "WoM_Skipped_Tutorial_1": "Can I help you?",
        "Playerchoice_WhoAreYou": "Who are you?",
        "Playerchoice_TellMeAboutAshenfall": "Can you tell me about Ashenfall?",
        "Playerchoice_IKnowYou": "I recognise you from the wanted posters!",
        "WoM_SkippedTutorial_WhoAreYou_1": "Oh, the cruelty of time, erasing even our deeds. I was once a famous and adored hero. Now everyone just calls me \"that wise old man\". Rude really.",
        "WoM_SkippedTutorial_IKnowYou_1": "A lifetime of heroism, and no recognition. But you rob one bank, and suddenly everyone knows your name!",
        "WoM_SkippedTutorial_CanYouTellMeAboutAshenfall_1": "We've not been here that long, but I can tell you that Ashenfall is special. You must feel it? Magic everywhere?",
        "WoM_SkippedTutorial_CanYouTellMeAboutAshenfall_2": "The whole continent feels like its infused with anima. Literally pouring out of the ground in some places. That's just not normal.",
        "WoM_SkippedTutorial_CanYouTellMeAboutAshenfall_3": "Probably goes someway to explaining the enormous dragon that wants to kill us... along with all the other things that want to kill us.",
        "Doric_SkippedTutorial_Intro_1": "Strange place this. Ashenfall, I mean. Could make a real home here, if things stopped trying to kill us.",
        "Doric_SkippedTutorial_WhoAreYou_1": "Me? Name's Doric. I'm just a stupid old blacksmith that got swept up in tales of adventure. Trying to win back me glory days.",
        "Doric_SkippedTutorial_WhoAreYou_2": "Left my son behind to watch the shop. Good lad, gonna do good things. Hope he's not too worried about his dad.",
        "Doric_SkippedTutorial_WhoAreYou_3": "Still, no point lollygagging around. I'll catch my breath and then explore these new lands. Who knows? Might find something.",
        "Doric_SkippedTutorial_CanYouTellMeAboutAshenfall_1": "It's a wild place this. Beasties everywhere, and no civilisation in sight. Just the remnants, ghosts of the past.",
        "Doric_SkippedTutorial_CanYouTellMeAboutAshenfall_2": "But you see that great tower, off in the distance? That's dragonkin that is. Means there's probably stuff worth finding about this place.",
        "Zanik_SkippedTutorial_Intro1": "A new adventure is always exciting, don't you think? We lost some good people... friends... but we need to push forward, in their memory.",
        "Zanik_SkippedTutorial_WhoAreYou_1": "I'm Zanik, I'm a cave goblin. Sort of like the goblins over there in Bramblemead village... only we chose a peace over violence.",
        "Zanik_SkippedTutorial_WhoAreYou_2": "Most of my people stay underground, hiding from the surface. But I couldn't wait to explore this vast and wonderful world.",
        "Zanik_SkippedTutorial_WhoAreYou_3": "I'm regretting it a bit, what with big scary dragons and all, but I'm excited too. Looking forward to learn everything about this place.",
        "Zanik_SkippedTutorial_CanYouTellMeAboutAshenfall_1": "There are goblins here, that's unexpected. I thought I knew about all the tribes, but there's a whole load of them here.",
        "Zanik_SkippedTutorial_CanYouTellMeAboutAshenfall_2": "I wonder why they're not in the history books.",
        "Zanik_SkippedTutorial_CanYouTellMeAboutAshenfall_3": "As well as goblins, look at the creatures here. So vibrant and full of life. This whole place feels... magical.",
        "Vannaka_SkippedTutorial_Intro_1": "Keep your wits about you, young pup. Ashenfall is home to many a dangerous beast, and I've not yet tested my blade against each of them.",
        "Vannaka_SkippedTutorial_WhoAreYou_1": "My name is Vannaka and back on the mainland I was a Slayer Master. It was my job to send adventurers after dangerous beasts.",
        "Vannaka_SkippedTutorial_WhoAreYou_2": "Cull the population of monsters, to make the world a better place.",
        "Vannaka_SkippedTutorial_WhoAreYou_3": "I was finding things a little stale on the mainland. When I saw the posters for the expedition, I felt a pull... a call to adventure that I could not resist.",
        "Vannaka_SkippedTutorial_CanYouTellMeAboutAshenfall_1": "Be ready to fight, that's my first piece of advice. Craft armour, weapons and anything else you need for battle.",
        "Vannaka_SkippedTutorial_CanYouTellMeAboutAshenfall_2": "There are goblins everywhere in Bramblemead and deadlier things beyond.",
        "Vannaka_SkippedTutorial_CanYouTellMeAboutAshenfall_3": "Past Bramblemead is Ghornfell, a place of danger and excitement. Something calls to me out there and I intend to seek it out.",
        "WS_WiseOldMan_Wardstone_Choice_01": "Ah, hello. What would you like to discuss?",
        "WS_Playerchoice_Askabout_Wardstone": "Ask about Lifeward.",
        "WS_Playerchoice_Askabout_DragonSlayer": "Ask about the Dragon Slayer quest. ",
        "WoM_Generic_Hrmm": "Hrmm?",
        "Doric_RTftJ_GotCleanWater1": "Ah, good, you've got some nice clean water there. The water in lakes and rivers tends to be dirty, tainted by something nasty that will make life difficult if you drink too much. "
